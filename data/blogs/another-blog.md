# Hello World from Next.js

This is my first blog post stored in GitHub and fetched by Next.js. By setting `published: true`, I can ensure this post is displayed on my site.

## Why Next.js?

- **SSR and SSG**: Helps with performance and SEO.  
- **Easy Data Fetching**: Integrates smoothly with external APIs or GitHub content.  
- **Dynamic Routing**: Perfect for building a blog with [slug]-based routes.
