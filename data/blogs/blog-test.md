# A Deep Dive into GitHub Content Management

This post explores how to use GitHub as a content store for your Next.js application. However, it’s marked as `published: false`, so it won't appear on the site.

## Key Points

1. **Version Control**: Keep track of changes and easily roll back if needed.  
2. **Pull Requests**: Collaborate with team members.  
3. **APIs**: Fetch data on demand using GitHub’s REST or GraphQL API.  
4. **Webhooks**: Trigger builds or updates when content changes.
